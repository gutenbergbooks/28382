<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"The King," says <i>The Manchester
Courier</i>, "has returned all his German
Orders." So much for the taunt that
Britain's object in taking part in the
War was to pick up German orders.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We hear that, in addition to lowering
the lights at night, the authorities
intend, in order to confuse the enemy,
to alter the names of some of our
thoroughfares, and a start is to be
made with Park Lane, which is to be
changed to Petticoat Lane.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is reported to have received
a nice letter from his old friend
<span class="sc">Abdul</span> ("the D&mdash;&mdash; d"), pointing out
that it is the fate of some kind and
gentle souls to be misunderstood.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Matches, it is stated, are required at
the front&mdash;to put an end, we believe, to
Tommy Atkins' reckless habit of lighting
his cigarette by applying it to the
burning fuse of a bomb.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Sikh non-commissioned officer
has, according to <i>The Central News</i>,
delivered himself of the following saying:&mdash;"Power
is to kings, but time
belongs to the gods. The Indians know
how to wait." This will no doubt call
forth an indignant rejoinder from the
Teutonic Waiters' Association.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Property insured in London is
valued at &pound;1,320,000,000," according to
an announcement made by Lord <span class="sc">Peel</span>
last week. One can almost hear the
<span class="sc">Kaiser</span> smacking his lips.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At last the authorities have acted,
and the premises of a German firm with
concrete foundations have been raided.
This bears out the promise of certain
high officials who declared that they
would take action when a concrete
example was brought to their notice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The official "Eye-Witness" in a
recent despatch tells us how a British
subaltern saw, from a wood, an unsuspecting
German soldier patrolling
the road. Not caring to shoot his man
in cold blood, he gave him a ferocious
kick from behind, at which the startled
German ran away with a yell. This
subaltern certainly ought to have
figured in "Boots' Roll of Honour"
which was published last week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Why, it is being asked, do not the
French retaliate for the damage done
by the Germans to their cathedrals
and drop bombs on Berlin? The
persons who put this question have
evidently never seen Berlin or they
would know that you cannot damage
its architecture if you try.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> has announced his intention
of eating his Christmas dinner in
London. We trust that Mr. <span class="sc">McKenna</span>
and his men will see to it that His
Majesty will, anyhow, find no mince
pies here. [<span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;"Mince pies"
should be pronounced "mean spies."
This greatly improves the paragraph.]</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to one report which reaches
us the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is now beginning to
quibble. He has pointed out that,
when he said he would eat his Christmas
dinner at Buckingham Palace, he
did not mention which Christmas.</p>

<h2>TOMMY BROWN, RECRUITING SERGEANT.</h2>

<p>Tommy Brown had been moved up into Form II., lest
he should take root in Form I. He had been recommended
personally by the master of Form I. to Mr. Smith, the
guardian deity of Form II., as "the absolute limit." After
a year of Tommy, Mr. Smith had begun to mention him in
his prayers, not so much for Tommy's good as for his own
deliverance&mdash;mentally including him in the category of
plague, pestilence, famine and sudden death.</p>

<p>Though the pervading note of Mr. Smith's report upon
Tommy was gloom, deep gloom, he must have had some
dim hopes of him, for, at the end of the Summer Term, he
had placed his hand upon Tommy's head and said, "Never
mind, my boy, we shall make a man of you some day."</p>

<p>A new term had begun; Tommy Brown had mobilised
two days late, but he was in time for Mr. Smith's lecture
on "The War, boys."</p>

<p>The orator spoke for an hour and a quarter, and at the
end he wiped his brows with the blackboard duster under
the impression that it was his handkerchief. Meanwhile
Tommy had eaten three apples, caught four flies, written
"Kiser" in chalk on the back of the boy in front of him,
exchanged a catapult with Jones minor for a knife, cut
his finger, and made faces at each of the four new boys.
Mr. Smith caught him in one of these contortions, but he
was speaking of Louvain at the moment and took it as a
compliment.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tommy found himself confronted with a number
of sheets of clean paper. "The essay is to be written on
one side of the paper only," said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Tommy asked the boy next to him what they had to write
about, and the reply, "The War, you fool," set him thinking.</p>

<p>A deathlike stillness fell upon the room; Tommy Brown
looked round, frowned heavily, dipped his pen in the ink
and then in his mouth, and thought hard.</p>

<p>Then, after much frowning, he delivered himself of the
following, the ink being shared equally between himself and
the paper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wor was becose the beljums wouldent let the
jermens go over there fields so they put minds in the sea
and bunbarded people dead with airplans. It was shokkin.
The rushens have got a steme roler. We have got a garden
roler at home and I pull it sometimes. I dont like jermens.
Kitchener said halt your country needs you and weve got
a lot of drednorts. The airplans drop boms on anyone if
your not looking it isnt fare yours truly T. Brown."</p>

<p>The essay completed to his satisfaction, Tommy Brown
conveyed to his mouth a sweet the size and strength of
which fully justified the name "Britain's Bulwarks"
attached to it by the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>He then leaned back with the air of one who had done
his duty in the sphere in which he found himself and
proceeded to survey the room.</p>

<p>The other boys were still writing, and for fully half a
minute Tommy looked at them in pained surprise.</p>

<p>He then read his own essay again and, finding no flaw
in it, frowned once more on his fellow pupils and wrote:
"My father won the Victoria Cross Meddle." Having
written this he looked round again somewhat defiantly.
His eye caught one of the new boys beginning another sheet.</p>

<p>Tommy's essay just filled two-thirds of a page. He
would fight that new boy. Just then the words of a war
poster came into his head and he wrote in large letters:
"Your King and country want <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Tommy studied this for a minute, and then, as the
appeal seemed directed to himself, he wrote: "I'm not
old enuf or I'd go my brothers gone I'm not a funk I let
Jones miner push a needle into my finger to show him."</p>

<p>It seemed to Tommy Brown that the other boys possessed
some secret fund of information, even the new boys.
He'd show those new boys after school. Having made up
his mind on this point he printed at the bottom of his
essay, "Kitchener wants men." As an after-thought he
added, "My father was a man."</p>

<p>He let his gaze wander round the room until it fell upon
the face of his master, and then, under some impulse, he
wrote the fateful words, "Mr. Smith is a man."</p>

<p>"Finish off now!" rang out the command from Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Tommy saw the other boys putting sheet after sheet
together, and he had hardly filled one. He racked his
brains for something to add to his essay, and there came
to his mind the words written under his father's portrait.
He had only time to put down "England expecs&mdash;&mdash;"
when his paper was collected.</p>

<p>No one ever read Tommy Brown's essay excepting Mr.
Smith, and he burnt it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A lady teaches Form II. now, and Tommy Brown is
eagerly looking forward to the day when Mr. Smith will
return to occupy once more the post that is being kept
open for him, for Mr. Smith has promised to bring
Tommy home a German helmet.</p>

<h2>THE SUNDAY EVENING EDITION.</h2>

<p>Mrs. Henry looked up. "I think I
hear that boy again selling evening
papers," she said. "I suppose they
must come off the 9.5 train. But it's
a strange thing to happen on a Sunday&mdash;here."</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry was already at
the window. He threw it up and
leaned out.</p>

<p>"One can't approve of it, but I suppose
in war time&mdash;" Mrs. Henry was
beginning when her husband cut her
short. "Hush&mdash;I'm trying to hear
what he is saying. I wish boys could
be taught to speak distinctly." There
was a pause.</p>

<p>"I can't make him out." The Reverend
Henry's head reappeared between
the curtains. "It's really most exasperating;
I'd give a lot to know if the
Belgian army got out of Antwerp
before it fell."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you shout down and ask
him?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I cannot be discovered
interrogating urchins about secular
affairs from a second storey window
on Sunday evening. Still, I'd like to
know."</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry perambulated
the room with knitted brow.</p>

<p>"I never bought a Sunday paper of
any sort in my life. Never."</p>

<p>"I suppose one must have <i>some</i>
principles," said his wife.</p>

<p>"But it's enormously important, you
know. They may easily have been
surrounded and captured." He returned
to the window. "Hullo, he's gone to
the door. I say, Cook has bought
one. This is exciting. I should never
have thought Cook would have done
that."</p>

<p>"It raises rather a nice point," said
Mrs. Henry.</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry returned resolutely
to his book. The shouts of the
newsvendor died away.</p>

<p>"We must not forget," said the
Reverend Henry irrelevantly, "that
Cook is a Dissenter." Then suddenly
he broke out. "I wish I knew," he
said. "I am not paying the least
attention to this book and I shan't
sleep well, and I shall get up about two
hours before the morning paper arrives,
and be restive till I know whether the
Belgians got out. But what am I to
do? I can't ask Cook."</p>

<p>"I might go down," his wife volunteered.
"I needn't say anything about
it, you know. I could just stroll about
the kitchen and change the orders for
breakfast. The paper is pretty sure to
be lying about. There may be headlines."</p>

<p>"No," said the Reverend Henry
with determination, "I really cannot
consent to it."</p>

<p>"Well, I may as well go to bed.
Don't sit up late."</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry did sit up rather
late. He was wide awake and ill at ease.
At last he listened intently at the door
and then took a candle and stole down
the passage.</p>

<p>The Reverend Henry had not been
in his own kitchen for close upon ten
years, and he did not know the way
about very well. He had adventures
and some moments of rigid suspense
while the clatter of a kicked coal-scuttle
died away in the distance. But when
at last he crept noiselessly up-stairs
he was assured of a good night's rest.</p>

<p>"What a mess your hands are in,"
said Mrs. Henry sleepily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Henry. "That miserable
woman had used it to lay the fire.
But it's all right. They did get out&mdash;most
of them."</p>

<h2>UNINTELLIGENT ANTICIPATION.</h2>

<p>"My dear," I said, "you are always
proposing things, and then, when they
are carried <i>nem. con.</i>, you argue against
your own proposal."</p>

<p>"It's unfair to use Greek to me."</p>

<p>"<i>'Nem. con.</i>,'" I said, "is rich old
Castilian and, put simply, means that
nobody&mdash;I am nobody&mdash;objects."</p>

<p>"But we can't afford a new tea-set."</p>

<p>"Then why did you ask so many to
tea at once?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think," said
Alison. "They are coming
to make pyjamas for our
soldiers in the trenches,
and I simply thought
that the more people came
the more pyjamas there
would be."</p>

<p>"How many cups have
we?"</p>

<p>"Only five tea-cups.
Jessie broke two more
yesterday, and there's one
with a piece out that
you or I could use. Oh!
and there are the two
breakfast cups and two
odd ones which would
make up the number, but
they're such a mixed lot."</p>

<p>Jessie is our domestic
staff and a champion
china-breaker.</p>

<p>"If Jessie," I said,
"were not so good to
young Peter I should insist
on handing her back her
credentials. Hold! I have
the germ of an idea. Leave
me to work it out, please.
I see credit, nay kudos,
in it."</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes
Alison looked in
again.</p>

<p>"I'm just putting the
finishing touches," I said.
"Kindly ask Peter to spare me a few
moments. He's sailing his boats in
the bath, I imagine. By the way,
what time are these people coming?"</p>

<p>"Half-past four," said Alison, "and
it's now nearly four."</p>

<p>"Then please see that Jessie brings
in tea at five exactly."</p>

<p>"Why exactly?" said Alison.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I said. "Five is a very
good hour, and it's part of my scheme."</p>

<p>"It's most mysterious," said Alison.</p>

<p>"It's particularly ingenious," I said.
"Everything dovetails in beautifully,
and if you'll carry out your small share
all will be well. By the way, if I make
any remark to the company before tea
which is not&mdash;er&mdash;strictly true, you will
please to take no notice of it.</p>

<p>"I'll try not to," said Alison, "if it
isn't too outrageous."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I said, "nothing to shy
at. But I might find it necessary to
say something about a Worcester tea-set.
Listen," I said before she could
interrupt. "When you hear me say,
'Worcester tea-set' you say 'Great
heavens!' or whatever women say
under stress of great emotion. But sit
tight. Don't go and see about it."</p>

<p>"See about what?"</p>

<p>"The Worcester tea-set, of course."</p>

<p>"But we haven't got one."</p>

<p>"My dear girl," I said, "try to
imagine we have. In this little drawing-room
comedy you've only one line
to learn, and your cue's 'Worcester
tea-set.'"</p>

<p>"But what's the idea?" said Alison.</p>

<p>"The idea," I said, "is great, but it
is as well you should not know the
whole plot of the piece yet. Play your
one line, and I, as stage manager, will
answer for the rest of the cast."</p>

<p>"And what's Peter got to do with it?
I want him to have tea with Jessie."</p>

<p>"Right," I said. "Peter's part is
important, but is played off&mdash;in the
wings, as it were."</p>

<p>My interview with Peter was not a
long one.</p>

<p>"Now look here, old pal," I said at
the close, "quarter to exactly, in the
bathroom."</p>

<p>"Right-o! Daddy." Peter (&aelig;tat. 9)
has a wrist-watch already and winds
it regularly, so I knew he wouldn't
fail me.</p>

<p>At a quarter to five I was talking to
Mrs. Padbury, the Rector's wife, about
the doings of the various Armies in the
field. I was sitting in such a position
that, while seeming to attend only to
her, I could keep an eye on the drawing-room
clock behind her.
Every detail of my scheme
had been carefully
arranged; it now only
remained for the actors
to play their ...</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Crash!</p></div>

<p>"Bless my soul," I said,
"that sounds remarkably
like the Worcester tea-set,"
and looking at the
clock again I knew that
Peter had made the "loud
noise off", at the exact
moment. "Good lad," I
said to myself.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" said
Alison.</p>

<p>I was delighted. I had
been more afraid of Alison's
getting stage fright than
of anything else, and there
she was playing her part
like a veteran actress.
Things were going really
splendidly.</p>

<p>It was at this precise
moment that the grandfather
clock in the kitchen
gave out the first stroke
of five, and at the same
moment Jessie entered
bearing a tray, on which
were the five drawing-room
tea-cups which were
intact, the single ditto with
a piece out, two breakfast
cups and two odd ones.</p>

<p>So the one player, the kitchen clock,
whose part had been overlooked, had
spoilt the whole show by being nearly
fifteen minutes fast; and the fact that
Jessie tripped on the doormat as she
came in, with fatal results to the rest
of our tea-things, was a mere circumstance.</p>

<p>Alison blames me for everything.</p>

held at the Rectory.</p>

<p>The St. John Ambulance Association, which forms part of the Red
Cross Organisation of Great Britain, derives its name and traditions
from the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitallers), founded
at the time of the Crusades. It has at this moment many thousands of
workers engaged in tending the wounded at the seat of war and in the
hospitals of the Order.</p>

<p>In peace time it does not appeal to the public for subscriptions, but
under the stress of war it finds itself in urgent need of help, and is
absolutely compelled to ask for funds. Gifts should be sent to the Chief
Secretary, Colonel Sir Herbert C. Perrott, Bt., C.B., at St. John's Gate,
Clerkenwell, E.C., and cheques should be crossed "London County and
Westminster Bank, Lothbury," and made payable to the St. John
Ambulance Association. In aid of its work, a Concert (at which
Madame Patti will sing) is to be given at the Albert Hall on Saturday
afternoon, October 24th.</p>

<p><i>Judge Hallers.</i> At the back of the
head. I've never been myself since I
fell off my bicycle. My memory goes.</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> Ah, I know what you want.
Open your mouth. (<i>Inserts thermometer.</i>)
This will cure you ... Good

<p><i>Hallers.</i> There you are, that's what
I mean. I thought it was asparagus
for the moment. Haven't you another
one on you?</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> Tut, tut, this is very singular.
(<i>Makes another effort to grapple with
it.</i>) What books have you been reading
lately?</p>

It's all rubbish.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Ferrier.</i> Good morning, Judge.
I've come with that other thermometer.
I have ventured to tie a piece of string
to it, so that in case the&mdash;er&mdash;temperature
goes down again&mdash;&mdash; But what's
happened here? You seem all upset.</p>

<p><i>Hallers.</i> Burglary. I dropped asleep
at my desk here last night, and when
I wake up I find that a criminal called
The Baron and two accomplices have
burgled my house. The Baron escaped,
but Heidegg caught the others.</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> Extraordinary thing. What
theatres have you been to lately?</p>

<p><i>Hatters.</i> Only the Garrick. (<i>Enter</i>
Heidegg.) Well, anything fresh to
report, Inspector?</p>

<p><i>Heidegg.</i> Yes, Judge. The prisoners
say that you are The Baron. But they
say you had a muffler on last night.
That might account for our dachshunds
missing the scent.</p>

<p><i>Hallers.</i> Good heavens, what do
you make of this, Doctor?</p>

<p><i>Ferrier</i> (<i>picking up programme</i>).
Cases showing prevalence of this mental
disorder&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hallers.</i> You mean I am a dual
personality! (<i>Covers his face with his
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> Come, come, control yourself.</p>

<p><i>Hallers</i> (<i>calmly</i>). It is all right; I
am my own man&mdash;I mean my own two
men again. What shall I do?</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> You must wrestle with your
second self. I will hypnotise you.
(<i>He glares at him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hallers</i> (<i>after a long pause</i>). Well,
why don't you begin?</p>

<p><i>Ferrier.</i> You ass, I'm doing it all
the time. This is the latest way....
There! Now then, wrestle!</p>

the treatment every morning&mdash;say for
half an hour before the bath. Good
day to you.</p>

<h2>WAR ITEMS.</h2>

<p>The reiterated accusations made by
Germany of the use of dum-dum
bullets by the Allies, although they are
not believed by anyone else, appear to
be accepted without question by the
German General Staff. New measures
of retaliation are being taken, which,
while not strictly forbidden by International
Law, may at any rate be said
to contravene the etiquette of civilised
warfare. We learn from Sir JOHN
FRENCH'S Eye-witness that numbers of
gramophones have made their appearance
in the German trenches north of
the Aisne River.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Papers captured in the pocket of a
member of the German Army Service
Corps contain bitter complaints of the
enormous strain thrown upon the
already over-taxed railway system in
Germany by the <span class="sc">Kaiser's</span> repeated
journeys to and fro between the
Eastern and the Western Theatres of
War. He is referred to (rather flippantly)
as "The Imperial Pendulum"
(<i>Perpendikel</i>). The writer, while recognising
the eager devotion with
which the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> is pursuing his search
for a victory in the face of repeated
disappointment, congratulates himself
that the Imperial journeys, though
they are not likely to be discontinued,
will at least grow shorter and shorter
as time goes on. Indeed, it is hoped
that before long a brief spin in the
Imperial automobile-de-luxe will cover
the ground between the Eastern and
Western Theatres.</p>

<hr />

<h2>WORKS OF KULTUR.</h2>

<p>In some respects, apparently, the
enemy has been less affected by the
War than we have. While in England
the book-trade has been slightly depressed,
in Germany it seems to be
flourishing. We give samples from the
latest catalogues:&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="sc">Poetry.</span></center>

<p>The most interesting volume announced
is <i>A Hunning We Will Go,
and Other Verses</i>, by <span class="sc">William Hohenzollern</span>,
whose <i>Bleeding Heart</i> attracted
so much attention.</p>

<center><span class="sc">History.</span></center>

<p><i>Kaiser's Gallic War Books, I. &amp;
II.</i>, a new edition, very much revised
since August by General <span class="sc">von Kluck</span>
and other accomplished scholars, are
certain to be of great use for educational
purposes.</p>

<center><span class="sc">Natural History.</span></center>

<p>In this department a work likely to
be enquired for is <i>The Dogs of St.
Bernhardi</i>, by General <span class="sc">von Moltke</span>.</p>

<center><span class="sc">Fiction.</span></center>

<p>The demand for fiction in Germany
is said to be without parallel and the
supply appears to be not inadequate.
Among forthcoming volumes there
should be a demand for <i>Der Tag; or,
It Never Can Happen Again</i>.</p>

<center><span class="sc">General.</span></center>

<p><i>Proverbial Philosophy</i> contains the
favourite proverbs of various persons of
eminence. From the Imperial <span class="sc">Finance
Minister</span> comes: "It's never too late
to lend." From General <span class="sc">Manteuffel</span>
(the destroyer of Louvain library): "Too
many books spoil the Goth." The
<span class="sc">Crown Prince</span> contributes: "Beware
the rift within the loot."</p>

<h2>ZEITUNGS AND GAZETTINGS.</h2>

<center><span class="sc">Roosevelt Unmasked.</span></center>

<p>It is sad to relate, but persistent
efforts to maintain the disinterested
claim on American friendship which
we Germans have always (when in
need of it) advanced, continue to be
misrepresented in that stronghold of
atheistical materialism and Byzantine
voluptuousness, New York. To the
gifted Professor von Schwank's challenge,
that he could not fill a single
"scrap of paper" with the record of
acts of war on our part which were
incompatible with Divine guidance and
the promulgation of the higher culture,
the effete and already discredited
<span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> has merely replied,
"Could fill Rheims." This is
very poor stuff and worthy only
of a creature who combines with
the intellectual development of
a gorilla the pachymenia of
the rhinoceros and the dental
physiognomy of the wart-hog.
<span class="sc">Roosevelt</span>, once our friend, is
plainly the enemy and must be
watched. Should he decide,
however, even at the eleventh
hour, to fall in line with civilisation,
he can rely on finding in
Germany, in return for any little
acts of useful neutrality which
he may be able to perform, a
generous ally, a faithful upholder
of treaty obligations,
and a tenacious friend. There
must surely be something that
America covets&mdash;something belonging
to one of our enemies.
Between men of honour we need
say no more.</p>

<center><span class="sc">Base Calumny Exposed.</span></center>

<p>Let us speak plainly with regard
to the Rheims affair. We
have successively maintained
that this over-rated monument of
Arimaspian decadence (1) was not injured
in any way; (2) was only blown
to pieces in conformity with the rules
of civilised warfare; (3) was mutilated
and fired by our unscrupulous and
barbaric opponents themselves; (4)
was deliberately pushed into our line of
fire on the night of the 19th September;
(5) never existed at all, being indeed an
elaborate but puerile fiction basely invented
by a baffled enemy with the object
of discrediting our enlightened army in
the eyes of neutral Powers. Any of
these was good enough, but what now
appears is better. Exact measurements
have since demonstrated beyond all
question of cavil that Rheims Cathedral
had been built with mathematical
accuracy to shield our contemptible
enemy's trenches around Chalons from
our best gun positions outside Laon.
This act of treachery proves that, instead
of Germany being the aggressor,
France has been cunningly preparing
ever since 1212 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> for the war which
at last even our chivalrous diplomacy
has been powerless to avert.</p>

<center><span class="sc">Generous Offer to Monaco.</span></center>

<p>It is time for Monaco to reconsider
its position. Should it maintain its
present short-sighted and untenable
neutrality what has it to gain from
England, France, or Russia? Nothing
that it has not already got. Monaco
very naturally wants something more.
Let us be frank. We of Germany
speak very differently. It is not desirable
to be specific, but short of that
we may say that whatever Monaco
asks for it will be promised. England,
we would then repeat, is the enemy.
Has Monaco forgotten the sinister
malignity of an article in an English
paper disclosing "How to Break the
Bank at Monte Carlo." It is unnecessary
to labour the point, to which we
will return in our next issue. Monaco,
in short, like Turkey, Bolivia, China,
the United States, Hayti and Oman, is
the natural ally of Germany.</p>

<h2>THE SLUMP IN CRIME.</h2>

<p>"Praise is due to criminals," remarked
Mr. <span class="sc">Robert Wallace, K.C.</span>,
at the London Sessions, "for the self-control
they are exercising during this
period of stress and anxiety."</p>

<p>It is to be feared that Mr. <span class="sc">Wallace's</span>
views are not entirely shared by the
legal profession. As the junior partner
in Mowlem &amp; Mowlem confided to our
representative: "That's all very fine,
but what's to become of <i>us</i>? Not a
burglar on our books for the last six
weeks. Not a confidence man; not a
coiner; not a note expert. And they
had the opportunity of their lives with
the <span class="sc">John Bradbury</span> notes! We
shall have to shut up our office,
and then what's to become of
our clerk? What's to become
of our charwoman? I ask you,
what's to become of our charwoman's
poor old husband dependent
on her? No, let's have
patriotism in its <i>right</i> place!"</p>

<p>An old-established firm of
scientific implement merchants
showed even more indignation.
"We had taken our place in
the firing-line in the War on
Germany's Trade," they declared.
"We had made arrangements
for home manufacture
to supplant the alien jemmy.
No British burglar would need to
be equipped with anything but
all-British implements, turned
out in British factories and
giving employment to British
workmen only. And now what
do we find? The market has
gone to pot. Yes, Sir, to pot.
And that's the reward for our
patriotic efforts!"</p>

<h2>WITH HIGH HEART.</h2>

<p>The long line of red earth twisted
away until it was lost in the fringe of
a small copse on the left and had dipped
behind a hillock on the right. Flat
open country stretched ahead, grass
lands and fields of stubble, lifeless and
deserted.</p>

<p>There was no enemy to be seen and
not even a puff of smoke to suggest his
whereabouts. But the air was full of
the booming of heavy guns and the
rising eerie shriek of the shrapnel.</p>

<p>Behind the line of red earth lay the
British, each man with his rifle cuddled
lovingly to his shoulder, a useless
weapon that yet conveyed a sense of
comfort. The shells were bursting with
hideous accuracy&mdash;sharp flashes of
white light, a loud report and then a
murderous rain of shrapnel.</p>

<p>"Crikey!" said a little man in filthy
rain-sodden khaki, as a handful of earth
rose up and hit him on the shoulder;
"crikey! that was a narsty shave for
your uncle!"</p>

<p>The big man beside him grunted and
shifted half an inch of dead cigarette
from one corner of his mouth to the
other. "You can 'old my 'and," said
he with a grin.</p>

<p>Four or five places up the trench a
man stumbled to his knee, coughed
with a rush of blood and toppled over
dead.</p>

<p>"Dahn and aht," said the big man
gruffly. "Gawd! If we could get at
'em!"</p>

<p>The wail of a distant shell rose to a
shriek and the explosion was instantaneous.
The little man suddenly went
limp and his rifle rolled down the bank
of the trench.</p>

<p>His friend looked at him with
unspeakable anguish. "Got it&mdash;in the
perishing neck this time, Bill," gasped
the little man.</p>

<p>Bill leaned over and propped his pal's
head on his shoulder. A large dark
stain was saturating the wounded man's
tunic and he lay very still.</p>

<p>"Bill," very faintly; then, with surprise,
"Blimey! 'E's blubbing! Poor
old Bill!"</p>

<p>The big man was shaking with
strangled sobs. For some moments he
held his friend close, and it was the
dying man who spoke first.</p>

<p>"Are we dahn-'earted?" he said.
The whisper went along the line and
swelled into a roar.</p>

<p>The big man choked back his sobs.
"No, old pal, no!" he answered,
and "No-o-o-o!" roared the line in
unison.</p>

<p>The little man lay back with a contented
sigh. "No," he repeated, and
closed his eyes for ever.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<center>"THE COST."</center>

<p><i>Mr. Samuel Woodhouse</i>, of the middle
classes, being anxious to distract
his son <i>John</i> during the critical moments
of <i>Mrs. John's</i> confinement,
relates how, in similar circumstances
more directly affecting himself, he had
been playing tennis, and the strain of
the crisis had quite put him off his
game. The little jest is, of course,
adapted from the familiar lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was playing golf the day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Germans landed ..."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is of material interest not so much
because it is borrowed (for it is not the
only joke that Mr. <span class="sc">Thurston</span> has conveyed)
as because it serves as a brief epitome
of the play. For the thing started
with the War, and we were getting on
quite well with it when an element of
obstetrics was introduced and became
inextricably interwoven with the original
design. Indeed it went further
and affected the destinies of the country
at large. For England had to wait till
the baby was born before it could
secure its father's services as the most
unlikely recruit in the kingdom.</p>

<p>But you must hear more about this
<i>John</i>. He was an intellectual who
threatened to achieve the apex of
literary renown with a work in two
volumes (a third was to follow) on the
Philosophy of Moral Courage. At the
outbreak of the present war he was at
once torn asunder between his duty to
his country and his duty to himself. The
latter seemed to have the greater claim
upon him, and this view was encouraged
by an officer who found himself
billeted upon the Woodhouse
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>. The dilemma had already worried
<i>John</i> (and us) a good deal even before
the extension of the age limit made him
roughly eligible for the army. Indeed
I never quite gathered what it was
that ultimately decided him to enlist.
Anyhow, six months later he received
a bullet in the head, and the wound,
though I am glad to say that he survived
it, left him incapable of any
further intellectual strain.</p>

<p>That was "the cost" of the war to
him. Its cost to us (in the play) was
almost as heavy. For <i>John's</i> head still
retained such a command of brain power
that he contrived to be very fluent over
his theories of war in general, theories
not likely to be of any vital service at a
time when our men of fighting age are
wanted to act and not think.</p>

<p>I give little for Mr. <span class="sc">Thurston's</span> generalities
(his talk of "hysteria," which
was never a British foible, showed his
lack of elementary observation), but
the character of <i>John</i> intrigued me as
a fair example of the type of egoist,
very common among quite good fellows,
who is more concerned to satisfy his
own sense of the proper thing to do
than to consider in what way, less
romantic perhaps, he can best devote
to the service of his country the gifts
with which nature has endowed him.</p>

<p>The play went very well for the first
two Acts. The various members of
the <i>Woodhouse</i> family were excellently
differentiated. The father (played with
admirable humour by Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick
Ross</span>) bore bravely the shock to his
trade, and took a manly but quite ineffectual
part in household duties for
which he had no calling. His lachrymose
wife (Miss <span class="sc">Mary Rorke</span>) was a
sound example of the worst possible
mother of soldiers. <i>John</i> we know, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Owen Nares</span> knew him too, and very
thoroughly. <i>John's</i> wife (I can't think
how she came to marry him) had the
makings of an Amazon and would
gladly have spared her husband for
<span class="sc">Kitchener's</span> Army at the earliest moment.
Her part was played very
sincerely and charmingly by Miss
<span class="sc">Barbara Everest</span>. <i>John's</i> eldest
sister regretted the war because she
had some nice friends in Germany, but
she caught the spirit of menial service
from her sisters, of whom the younger
was a stage-flapper of the loudest. Finally
the second son (Mr. <span class="sc">Jack Hobbs</span>)
was a nut who began with his heart in
his socks but shifted it later into the
enemy's trench.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best performance of all&mdash;though
it had little to do with the
war and nothing to do with child-birth&mdash;was
that of Miss <span class="sc">Hannah Jones</span> as
<i>Mrs. Pinhouse</i>, a perfect peach of a
cook. There were also two characters
played off. One was a maid-servant
who declined to come to family prayers
on the ground of other distractions. I
admired her courage. The other was
<i>Michael</i>, the precious infant whose
entry into the world had occupied so
much of our evening. Everybody on
the stage had to have a look at him.
I felt no such desire. He bored me.</p>

<p>For a play that made pretence to a
serious purpose there was far too much
time thrown away on mere trivialities.
At first the exigencies of the stage
demanded compression. The news of
the ultimatum to Germany, the mobilisation,
the rush to enlist, the attack
on Germany's commerce, were all
stuffed into the space of a few
minutes. But the whole of the Third
Act (laid in the kitchen) was wantonly
wasted over the thinnest of domestic
humour.</p>

<p>There is a light side, thank Heaven,
even to war; but Mr. <span class="sc">Thurston</span> had a
great chance of doing serious good and
he has only half used it. I am certain
(though he may call me a prig for saying
it) that if he had set himself to
serve his country's cause through the
great influence which the theatre commands,
he could have done better work
than this; and he ought to have done it.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors' Theatre is producing
a triple bill which includes a
"miniature revue" entitled <i>Odds and
Ends</i>. The cost of the production may
be gathered from the following note in

<blockquote>"N.B.&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">C. B. Cochran</span> has spared
no economy in mounting this Revue."</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>LITERARY GOSSIP.</h2>

<p>Among the more notable novels announced
for immediate publication is
<i>The Man in the Platinum Mask</i> by
Samson Wolf (Black and Crosswell).
By a curious and wholly undesigned
coincidence the name of the hero is
<span class="sc">Attila</span>, while a further touch of
actuality is lent to the romance by the
fact that the author's aunt's first
husband fought in the Italian War of
Independence.</p>

<p>Another story strangely opportune
in its title, which was however chosen
many months ago, is <i>With Nelson in
the North</i> by Hector Boffin (Arrow and
Long-i'-th'-bow). Its appeal to the
patriotic reader will be further enhanced
by the interesting news that
the author's wife's maiden name was
Collingwood, while he himself is a
great admirer of <span class="sc">Hardy</span>.</p>

<p>The same publishers also announce
a Life of <span class="sc">Attila</span> by Principal McTavish,
which was completed last March before
the name of the redoubtable Hun had
come so prominently before the public&mdash;- another
instance of the intelligent anticipation
which is the characteristic of
the best and most selling <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>.</p>

<p>Few writers of romance appeal to the
generous youth more effectively than
the Countess Corezeru, from whose
exhilarating pen we are promised a
tale of the Napoleonic era under the
engaging title of <i>The Green Dandelion</i>
(Merry and Bright). The pleasurable
expectations of her myriad readers will
be heightened when they learn the
interesting fact that the Countess recently
visited Constantinople, where
such thrilling happenings have lately
been in progress.</p>

<p>Yes, your designs on Belgium have been accomplished&mdash;for
the time. A people of sixty-five millions has prevailed
against a people of seven millions; a great army has overwhelmed
a little army; careful schemes long since prepared
have outmatched a trustfulness which you and your Ministers
fostered in order that in the dark you might be able to
strike a felon's blow with safety to yourself. No considerations
of honour hindered you. Indeed, I do not know
how I can bring myself to mention that word to one who
has acted as you have acted. If I do so it is in order that
I may tell you that for an Emperor (or any other man) to
be honourable it is not enough that he should have great
possessions, glittering silver armour, and armies obedient
to their War Lord's commands. It is not enough that he
should make resounding speeches and call God to witness
that he is His friend. It is not even enough that he should
succeed in carrying through his plans, and earn the
applause of those flatterers who, agreeing with you, believe
that an Emperor crowned with success and capable of
bestowing favours can do no wrong. No, there must be
something more than this. What that something is I will
not discuss with you. To do so would be useless, for, since
you will never possess it, you can never satisfy yourself
that I am right.</p>

<p>And even in regard to this "Success" with which you
comfort yourself are you so perfectly sure of it? How do
you feel when you call <span class="sc">von Moltke</span> to you and question
him about the progress of the war?</p>

<p>"How goes it," you say to him, "in the East?"
"We hope," he replies, "to hold the Russians in check,
but they are very numerous and very brave."
"Presumptuous villains! And in the West?"
"In the West the French and English," he says, "still
bear up against us. They have thrust us back day after day."
"May they perish! But, at any rate, there is Belgium.
Yes, we have crushed Belgium and taught the Belgians
what it means to defy our Majesty." And <span class="sc">von Moltke</span>,
no doubt, will murmur something that may pass for
approval and will withdraw from the conference.</p>

<p>I believe you admire <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>. Do you remember
what <i>Macbeth</i> says?</p>

<blockquote><p>"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well<br />
It were done quickly: if th' assassination<br />
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<br />
With his surcease, success; that but this blow<br />
Might be the be-all and the end-all here."</p></blockquote>

<p>But that it cannot be. Blows have their consequences,
immediate and remote. You first, and then your memory,
will be stained to all generations by this deed of treachery
and blood. How have you excused it? "With necessity,
the tyrant's plea." You had to hack your way through,
you said, and it was on my people that your battle-axe fell.
So when Louvain was burnt and its inhabitants were shot
down you assured the <span class="sc">President of the United States</span>
that your heart bled for what "necessity" had forced you
to do. President <span class="sc">Wilson</span> is a man of high principles and
deep feelings. I wonder how he looked and how he felt
when he read your whimpering appeal.</p>

<p>You have destroyed Belgium, but Belgium will rise
again; and, even if fate should ordain that Belgium is to
be for ever wiped away, so long as one Belgian is left alive
there will be a heart to execrate you and a voice to denounce
your deeds.</p>

<h2>THE SURPRISE.</h2>

<center><span class="sc">A Sequel to "The Choice."</span></center>

<p>Mr. Julius Bannockburn hung up his
hat with a bang and stepped angrily
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bannockburn was comfortably
seated in an arm-chair, with the tea-table
at her side and a fire blazing.</p>

<p>"That's right," she said placidly,
ignoring her husband's very obvious
mental disarray,&mdash;"just in time for a
cup of tea."</p>

<p>"No tea for me," he said darkly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. It'll do you good," she
replied, and poured some out.</p>

<p>"By the way, how much do you
give for this tea?" Mr. Bannockburn
sharply inquired.</p>

<p>"Two-and-eight," she replied.</p>

<p>He grunted. "I get excellent tea in
the City which retails at two shillings
a pound," he said. "Better than this."</p>

<p>"Well, dear," said Mrs. Bannockburn,
"you don't often have this. This is my
tea. You prefer Indian."</p>

<p>"And why so many different kinds
of cake?" Mr. Bannockburn went on.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't grudge me those?"
she answered. "Surely, even with the
war, little things like that might go
on?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bannockburn sent his eyes round
the room on a tour of critical exploration.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "and how can
you do with a fire&mdash;at any rate such a
fire&mdash;on a day like this? The room is
like an oven." He scowled murderously
at the innocent flames and opened the
window.</p>

<p>"I felt distinctly chilly," said Mrs.
Bannockburn. "Besides, a fire is so
much more cheerful."</p>

<p>"Cheerful!" said Mr. Bannockburn
with a snarl. "I'm glad something is
cheerful."</p>

<p>"My dear," said his wife soothingly,
"you're over-worried. You've had a
hard day at the office. But I've got
something to show you that will make
you happy again." She smiled gaily.</p>

<p>"Happy!" Mr. Bannockburn echoed
with abysmal bitterness. "Happy!"
He groaned.</p>

<p>"Yes, happy," said his wife. "Now
drink your tea," she added, "and then
light a cigar and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Cigars!" said. Mr. Bannockburn;
"I've done with cigars. At any rate
with Havanas. We're on the brink
of ruin, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Not any longer," said his wife with
a little confident laugh. "That's all
right now. Taking the new name was
to settle that, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Bannockburn was attempting to
eat a cake, but at these words he gave
it up. He struck a match angrily and
lit a cigar&mdash;a Havana. "Well, what
is it you want to show me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The cards," she said. "They look
splendid. Here," and she handed a
visiting-card across the table and drew
his attention to the delicate copper-plate
in which their new name had
been inscribed: "Mrs. Julius Bannockburn."</p>

<p>Mr. Bannockburn scowled afresh.
"How many of these have you
ordered?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Five hundred for each of us," she
replied. "And they're done. They all
came this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Bannockburn groaned again.
"What ridiculous haste!" he said.
"Where was all the hurry?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bannockburn laughed. "Well,
I must say!" she exclaimed. "You to
complain of things being done quickly!
I've done all you told me," she continued.
"Everything. I sent a notice
to the Post Office about the telephone
directory, telling them to alter the name.
I sent to <span class="sc">Kelly's</span> about the London
Directory. I told all the tradespeople.
I got the cards. I even went further
and ordered a few silver labels for your
walking-sticks and umbrellas. I thought
you would like that."</p>

<p>Mr. Bannockburn puffed at his cigar
and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Aren't I a good head clerk?" she
went on. "But, after all, when one
does change one's name it is wise to go
right through with it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her husband ominously,
"when one does change one's name."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Mrs. Bannockburn
asked sharply. "Has anything
gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"Everything," he said. "I've had
a notice forbidding changes of name
altogether. Everyone has had it."</p>

<p>"When did you get it?" his wife
inquired with a flutter.</p>

<p>"To-day."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," she said excitedly.
"We made the change several
days ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her husband, "but the
notice goes on to say that everyone who
has changed since the war began must
revert to the name he had before the
war commenced. You can't get away
from that."</p>

<p>"But we paid for it," Mrs. Bannockburn
exclaimed. "We paid for it.
Why did they take our money?"</p>

<p>"They didn't know then," said her
lord. "It's only just decided by this
infernal Government."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bannockburn turned white.
"This is terrible," she said. "And
how unfair! How grossly unfair! It's
not as if we were Germans. I'm not
a German at all, and you are merely a
German's son, and British to the core.
Of course they'll give the money
back?"</p>

<p>"It says nothing about that," replied
the Briton.</p>

<p>"How very unlike England!" she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed; "but the point is,
apart from the horrible expense of it
all, that here we are, saddled with a
name which is bound to keep customers
away and which we thought we had
got rid of for ever. It's horrible. It's
wrong. It's a shame." He paced the
room furiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bannockburn&mdash;or, as we now
should say, Mrs. Blumenbach&mdash;looked
in the fire for a few moments in silence.
"Well," she said at last, "we must
make the best of it, I suppose; we're
not paupers anyway, and things are
never so bad as one fears. After all,
we haven't been to so very much expense.
A few cards and so forth. You,
dear, can hardly have spent a penny
over it."</p>

<p>"Eh," said Mr. Blumenbach sharply&mdash;"what?"</p>

<p>"I said that the cost to which we
have gone since we changed our name
is very trifling," his wife repeated.
"You yourself have been put to no
expense at all, except perhaps office
paper."</p>

<p>Mr. Blumenbach looked suspiciously
at her and resumed his walk. "No,
no," he said; "that's fortunate certainly."</p>

<p>At this moment a servant entered
bringing the post, which included a
long roll of paper addressed to "Mrs.
Julius Bannockburn."</p>

<p>"I wonder what this can be," she
remarked as she reached for a paper-knife.</p>

<p>Her husband snatched it and held it
behind him. "Oh, I know all about
that," he said; "it's a mistake. It's
meant for me, not you."</p>

<p>"But it's addressed to me," said his
wife. "Please let me have it."</p>

<p>Mr. Blumenbach for a moment
flashed lightning. "Oh, all right," he
said, "take it. I might as well confess
to my folly, and, after all, I did it as a
pleasant surprise for you, even though
it's a failure. But I heard about some
heraldic fellow, and I got him to
draw me up a Bannockburn pedigree.
A Scotch one, you know. I was going
to have it framed in the hall. Burn
the thing without looking at it."</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;was it&mdash;very expensive?"
his wife asked tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Fifty pounds," he said, half in pride
at his own recklessness and half as
though having a tooth out.</p>

<p>"Fifty pounds!" Mrs. Blumenbach
moaned, and burst into tears.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</center>

<p>I can imagine the feelings of a romantic maiden who,
prone to choose her novels by title, has set down on her
library list <i>The Price of Love</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), and finds herself
landed with one of Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett's</span> intimate little
guides to "Bursley" and the four other drab towns. And yet
if she will set her teeth and read the first fifty pages without
skipping she will discover that she is being let into real
secrets of real human hearts; that handsome <i>Rachel</i> (penniless
companion to a benign old lady), and her debonair
<i>Louis</i> (who somehow never can run straight where money
is concerned), are becoming known to her as she knows few,
if any, of her friends; and that, because known, they are
extraordinarily interesting. She will see <i>Rachel</i> drawn out
of the haven of her staunch and critical common sense by
her infatuation for <i>Louis</i>; threatened by the shipwreck of
despair when she realises his weakness and her irrevocable
mistake, and again putting into a new harbour of
determination to pay the price of her love and make the
best of things. And I should not be altogether surprised
if even our romantic library-subscriber finds the next live-happily-ever-after
story a little flat by comparison. For
there is no doubt that Mr. <span class="sc">Bennett</span> has some uncanny
power of realising the conflict of human souls, and that
there is an astonishingly adroit method in his mania for
unimportant and unromantic detail. I refuse altogether to
accept as adequate (or appropriate) his explanations of the
adventures of the banknotes on the night of their disappearance,
but I am grateful for every word and incident of this
enchanting chronicle and for the portrait of <i>Rachel</i> in
particular.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Modern Pig-Sticking</i> (<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>) is a book that, appearing
at this particular moment, has an air of detachment
not without its own charm. Chiefly, of course, it appeals
to a special and limited public&mdash;a public, moreover, that is
at present too busy to give it the attention that it would
otherwise command. Certainly Major <span class="sc">A. E. Wardrop's</span>
spirited pages deserve to rank with the best that has been
written about this sport. As one frankly ignorant, I was
myself astonished to find how considerable a body is this
literature. As for the gallant Major's own contribution, it
is sufficiently well-written to make tales of sporting feats
and adventures interesting to the outsider. Which is saying
a lot. At the same time his sense of humour is sufficiently
strong to save enthusiasm from becoming oppressive.
Certainly he loves his theme, as I suppose a good pig-sticker
should. "To see hog and hunter charge each other bald-headed
with a simultaneous squeal of rage is," he says
youthfully, "always delightful." It is all, in these more
strenuous times, most refreshing and even a little wistful
in its <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>. The honest and brave gentlemen whose
exploits it records are about another kind of pig-sticking
now. One hopes that practice with the Indian variety
may help them in their chase of the Uhlan road-hog.
Here's power to their spears!</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>

<p>For all his good humour, Mr. <span class="sc">Pett Ridge</span> can say a
hard thing now and then about humanity in general and
point it with a touch of startling sarcasm. Possibly it is
this combination which makes him the favourite author he
is. While we get tired of the harsh satirist who is always
up against us, and pay little attention to his teaching, we
not only profit by the occasional home truths of the genial
humourist, but thoroughly enjoy hearing them. Certainly
it is not Mr. <span class="sc">Ridge's</span> plots which so attract everybody,
including myself. <i>The Happy Recruit</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) might
as well (or even better) have been plotless. There is the
central figure, <i>Carl Siemens</i>, who comes to England from
abroad in his youth and has an
unremarkable career, and there is
a mysterious and rather tiresome
trunk which is mentioned from
time to time and finally opened;
but apart from these the book is
but a collection of little episodes
more or less about the same people,
the <i>Maynard</i> family in particular.
It is not the story that lends the
charm but the people who come
into it, that upper-lower section
of Londoners whose little peculiarities
of thought, word and deed
Mr. Ridge so perfectly understands.
Through their mouths he utters
his truest sayings, and they make
his books always worth reading.
It should be added that this one
has nothing to do with present
warfare; it is antedated by a reign
and a half. In this the title is
misleading, for there are so many
recruits about nowadays and all of
them are happy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After reading Messrs. <span class="sc">Hutchinson's</span>
announcement that the
critics describe Mr. <span class="sc">F. Bancroft</span>
as the most remarkable South
African novelist now at work, I
searched for a talent that was too
successfully hidden for my finding.
I was on the track of it two or
three times, and once at least the
scent was so hot that I thought
the quarry was mine; but it got
away. With <i>Dalliance and Strife</i>
the author completes a trilogy upon
the Boer War, but here we are given too much flirtation and
too little fighting. His liberality in the matter of heroines
compensates me not at all for his niggard accounts of the
war. That he himself should apparently take more interest
in dalliance than in strife seems to indicate sheer perversity,
for, when once he has ceased to toy with tennis-teas and
trivialities, it is possible to respect the opinions of those
admiring critics even if it is impossible to agree with
them. The little fighting and the few whiffs of the
veldt that we are given come as welcome reliefs to the
rather stuffy atmosphere that Mr. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> has been
at such pains to create. The British officer in his hours
of dalliance is in his hands merely a figure of fun, but the
militant Boer in field and camp is a faithful picture, so faithful,
indeed, when contrasted with the other, that it leaves
me astounded at such a combination of skill and futility.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Germaine Damien</i> was a little girl with considerable
force of character. Having been told by a Socialist shoemaker
that Squires were a mistake, she endeavoured to
correct this error by driving a large knife into the first
specimen of the race whom she met. This was <i>Miles
Burnside</i>, a decent young man enough, and one obviously
qualifying to be the hero of the story. So that when, quite
early in its course, <i>Germaine</i> caught him asleep and apparently
left him dead with a dagger in his heart, I was for
a little time considerably puzzled as to how Mrs. <span class="sc">Baillie
Reynolds</span> was going to get on with her tale. However, I
need not have worried. Of course <i>Miles</i> was not dead;
indeed the last six words of the book tell you that "His
smile was good to see." And
naturally he wouldn't have been
smiling like that if he had not
been enfolding the heroine in
his strong arms. But before this
happy moment we had a lot to get
through. <i>Miles</i> on recovery had
told the properly apologetic <i>Germaine</i>
that she must never, never
let anybody else know about the
dagger business, and she said she
wouldn't. Personally, if I had
been <i>Germaine</i>, I should have
done the same. Later in life,
reflecting upon this injunction, and
discovering that her grandfather
had also killed a man, <i>Germaine</i>
got it into her head that the habit
was inherited, and the idea worried
her quite dreadfully. This, I suppose,
is why her story is called <i>The
Cost of A Promise</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>). Eventually, however,
when the thing had gone on
long enough and the revelation of
her secret had scared away a superfluous
rival, <i>Miles</i> informed her
that her grandfather's record was
(forgive me!) not germane to the
matter, and that she was as sane
as anybody in the story. M'yes.
But Mrs. <span class="sc">Reynolds</span> has done
better.</p>
